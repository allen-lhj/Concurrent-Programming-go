# Concurrent-Programming-go

## A road map

three parts with 12 chapters.
Part 1 introduces the fundamentals of concurrent programming and communication using memory sharing

- Chapter 1 introduces concurrent programming and talks about some of the laws governing parallel execution.

Building our own concurrency tools
1. mutex
2. condition variables
3. channels
4. semaphores

- Chapter 2 discusses the various ways we can model concurrency and the abstractions provided by operating systems and the Go runtime. The chapter also compares concurrency and parallelism.

Modeling concurrency in operating systems
Differentiating between processes and threads
Creating goroutines
Differentiating between concurrency and parallelism

### 2.1 Multiprocessing in operating systems
